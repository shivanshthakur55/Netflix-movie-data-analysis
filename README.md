                                       ====NETFLIX MOVIE DATA ANALYSIS USING PYTHON====

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization on a dataset of movies (presumably from Netflix or The Movie DB). The main objective is to analyze key movie-related features such as vote average, vote count, popularity, release date, and genres to uncover insights about viewer preferences and content trends.

The analysis is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook using Python's data science stack, including Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

üß† Key Objectives
1)Load and preprocess a movie dataset from a CSV file                                                                                                                                               
2)Understand the structure and statistics of the dataset                                                                                                                                       
3)Categorize movies based on vote averages into meaningful labels like:

POPULAR                                                                                                                                                                                      

4)Visualize the distribution of categories using bar plots                                                                                                                                             5)Improve graph readability using custom Y-axis scaling and labels
